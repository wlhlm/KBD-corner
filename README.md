Keyboard Corner

This repository contains many of my keyboard-related things including firmware
configuration. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contents of this

## Keyboards

Here is a list of my keyboard builds:

### K.T.E.C. Daisy

- keycaps: DSA Granite
- switches: Kailh Box Royal

### Realforce 87U 55g

My daily driver and mostly stock. Great for gaming. Only thing that bothers me
is the proprietary firmware. Had to repaint the switch plate since it started to
rust. Switch stems are lubed with Krytox GPL205G0.

- keycaps: stock Realforce, novelty Esc key
- switches: stock Topre 55g
